Description: Ubuntu Furry Remix stable components pre-release
 This package installs "stable" Furry Remix components, which are considered
 quite mature and suitable for everyday use. This package doesn't set them
 as default. Because this is pre-released version, it may still contain bugs
 (if you notice any, please report them in Launchpad).
