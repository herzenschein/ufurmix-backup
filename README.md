# Ufurmix Backup

Welcome! This repository serves as a clone to Ufurmix, 
[which was originally hosted on Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/ufurmix).

This is so people may have access to the existing content related to Ubuntu Furry Remix 
without having to use Launchpad's bazaar (bzr) utility for download.

Ubuntu Furry Remix, or simply Ufurmix, was a furry distribution 
whose latest release was during the time of Ubuntu 10.04, in 2012.

The folder launchpad-contents includes files downloaded from Launchpad using bzr, 
whereas the remaining folders were manually downloaded as per the Launchpad page.
